Apache Iceberg C++ library

# Apache Iceberg™ C++

Yet another C++ implementation of [Apache Iceberg™](https://iceberg.apache.org/).

We started it before [iceberg-cpp](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-cpp) appears. The library was a part of
closed source project for reading Iceberg data via some opensource DBMS we use.
Now we are happy to share results of our work with community to make the best Apache Iceberg™ C++ library together.

## Requirements

- C++20 compliant compiler
- CMake 3.20 or higher
- OpenSSL

### Build, Run Test

You have to [download Apache Arrow dependencies](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/15.0/developers/cpp/building.html#offline-builds) first.
```bash
mkdir _deps && cd _deps
git clone --single-branch -b maint-15.0.2 https://github.com/apache/arrow.git
cd arrow && git apply ../../vendor/arrow/fix_c-ares_url.patch && cd ..
./arrow/cpp/thirdparty/download_dependencies.sh ./arrow-thirdparty
```

```bash
mkdir _build
cd _build
ln -s ../_deps/arrow-thirdparty arrow-thirdparty
cmake -GNinja ../
ninja
cd tests/
../iceberg/iceberg-cpp-test
../iceberg/common/fs/iceberg_common_fs_test
./iceberg_local_test
```
